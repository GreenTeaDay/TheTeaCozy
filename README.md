# TheTeaCozy
“In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.”

The main issues are extra space at the bottom, the logo image not showing properly due to being a .webp, and aligning the text/box items under location. Ideally, this will be updated as soon as I am able, but I will continue on with my lesson plans for now and return to this so I do not lose further traction in this process. I will refine this over time or replace it with a my JS, CSS, HTML personal portfolio project soon. This was a learning project and might not make the portfolio officially.
